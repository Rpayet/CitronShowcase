# Wheels game rules

## Overview

Wheels is a duel game where two players compete to bring the opponent's health to zero. 
Each player has to choose two heroes from a pool of six, and each character has a unique set of abilities.
Those abilities can be used to attack the opponent, heal the player, or apply status effects.
To unlock the abilities, the player has to spin five wheels and match some symbols. On a turn the player can roll the wheels up to three times and save the symbols they want to keep. At the end of the turn the player can use the symbols to unlock the abilities of the heroes or to protect themselves from the opponent's attacks with a Bulwark.
