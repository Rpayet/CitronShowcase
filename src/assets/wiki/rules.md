# Wheels game rules

## Gameplay
### Overview

The goal in Wheels is to reduce your enemy’s HP (called the “Crown”) to zero before they can. You can protect your HP with a wall called a Bulwark. Bulwarks cap at 5 damage resistance/levels. Even if the damage goes over the Bulwark’s resistance level, the attack will not reach the Crown until it’s fully down. 
Some heroes are an exception to the rule.

For a hero to act, their rod must be fully down.
