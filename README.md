This repo was firest built to host the game "Wheels" from the video game "Sea of Stars". The game is still on development and not yet available to play. The project is a side-project realise on my free time (don't have a lot...), to improve my skills in programming and to have fun.

Today, the project is a portfolio of my work. It's a place where I can share my progress, my difficulties and my solutions. I will also share some side projects linked to the game.

To see further details about the game, please visit the [Wheels Game](src/components/arcade/wheels/README.md) page.
